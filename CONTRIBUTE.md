## How to Contribute

1. **Fork the repository** and create your branch from `main`.
2. **Make your changes** in a clear, focused way. Follow the existing code style and structure.
3. **Test your changes** locally. Ensure the app builds and runs, and that your changes do not break existing functionality.
4. **Document your changes** in code comments and, if relevant, in the `/Docs` folder.
5. **Submit a pull request** with a clear description of your changes and why they are needed.

## Guidelines
- Centralize all database logic in `webapp/lib/db.js`.
- Centralize all UI/UX (HTML, CSS, JSX) in `webapp/components/`.
- Do not put direct HTML/CSS in `pages/`â€”use components only.
- Keep documentation up to date when you add or change features.
- Write clear, concise commit messages.

## Reporting Issues
- Use the GitHub Issues page to report bugs or request features.
- Provide as much detail as possible, including steps to reproduce bugs.
